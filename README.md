# Discord RP Tag
I host a few different RP channels. Currently we post by manually following the format:

```
[character name] stuff the character says
```

But this is becoming a bit tedious to keep typing. So I'm building a simple bot that will allow players to designate a character
name for the specific channel (so different channels may have different character names) and when a message is sent, automatically
delete that message and post it with the tag applied.

Now, instead of doing that, I would like it much more if the bot would simply edit the message that's posted and apply the correct
tag, so it was still originally posted by the expected person. However editing other users posts appears to be something that 
Discord has no intention of allowing. So if that ever becomes an actual thing, I'll update this bot to do that instead.
